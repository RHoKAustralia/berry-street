React Demo
==========

Getting started
---------------

To install dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

Then compile the code:

```
npm run build
```

Then serve the `index.html` and `bundle.js` from a webserver.

If you want to run from a webserver, and don't know how:

```
npm install webpack-dev-server
```

```
webpack-dev-server
```

This will then tell you the URL used to serve up the frontend.
